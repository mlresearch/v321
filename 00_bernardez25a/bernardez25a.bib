abstract={This paper describes the 2025 edition of the Topological Deep Learning Challenge: Expanding the Data Landscape, hosted at the first Topology, Algebra, and Geometry in Data Science (TAG-DS) Conference. This year’s challenge aimed to address the data bottleneck in the field by systematically expanding the ecosystem of Topological Deep Learning (TDL). Powered by TopoBench, the challenge was organized into two primary missions: enriching the data landscape with diverse datasets, and advancing core data infrastructure. In particular, participants were invited to contribute to the open-source platform by implementing new dataset loaders, designing new benchmark tasks, or engineering robust, scalable data pipelines. The initiative successfully yielded 44 qualifying submissions. This paper outlines the scope of the competition and summarizes the key results and findings, highlighting the new resources now available to the TDL community.}
