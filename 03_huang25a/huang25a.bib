abstract={Bilevel optimization is central to many machine learning tasks, including hyperparameter learning and adversarial training. We present a novel single-level
reformulation for bilevel problems with convex lower-level objective functions and linear constraints. Our method eliminates auxiliary Lagrange multiplier variables by expressing them in terms of the original decision variables, which allows the reformulated problem to preserve the same dimension as the original problem. We applied our method to support vector machines (SVMs) and evaluated it on several benchmark tasks, demonstrating efficiency and scalability.}
