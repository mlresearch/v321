abstract = {Temporal link prediction seeks to model evolving networks to forecast future or missing interactions. Although many methods in this field achieve strong predictive performance, interpretability remains limited, especially in high-stakes domains. We address this by showing how topological data analysis can assess the faithfulness of learned representations to the underlying data, providing a pipeline for comparing temporal topological structure across modal output. We further introduce a prototypical model that enables this analysis while maintaining predictive power. Taken together, these contributions lay the groundwork for models whose representations are more transparent to end users.}
