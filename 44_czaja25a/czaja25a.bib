abstract = {We study the kernel PCA (kPCA) pre-image problem in image denoising by benchmarking classical algorithms and introducing two neural network adversarial pre-imaging models, DCGAN-KPCAnet and WGAN-KPCAnet. Our results show that WGAN-KPCAnet delivers superior reconstruction results and is robust to noise compared to baselines.}
