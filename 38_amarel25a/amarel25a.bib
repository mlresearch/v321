abstract = {We apply topological data analysis to characterize the simulated evolution of cracks in heterogeneous materials. Using persistence homology, we derive covariates for survival analysis, enabling lifetime prediction within a generalized linear modeling framework. Zeroth-homology features alone reproduce the ensemble survival curves of distinct materials, revealing that coarse topological statistics retain predictive signal even when important geometric details are abstracted away. We further compare the predictive capability of neural networks trained directly on damage fields with those trained on persistence-homology-derived representations, finding that the latter achieve superior accuracy. Finally, we investigate patched persistence homology, which encodes local topological information by computing persistence within spatial subdomains. This localized variant bridges global and geometric perspectives, capturing the collective mechanisms that govern fracture and may eventually yield representations better suited to the design and evaluation of fracture emulators.}
