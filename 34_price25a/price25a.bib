abstract = {A color digital photograph, of resolution $a\times b$, is typically stored as an $a\times b\times3$ array. The vector of length 3, sitting at a pixel, encodes its color in terms of intensity measurements of the red, green, and blue color bands. We call this length 3 vector a "pixel pole". Suppose we are given the $ab$ individual pixel poles as a jumbled collection of length 3 vectors and we wish to reconstruct the image, with no advanced knowledge concerning its content. In other words, we are given $ab$ color squares and we wish to "solve the pixel puzzle" meaning we want to reconstruct the original unknown image. As one can imagine, this is a difficult problem. In this paper, we show how to rebuild the images in a stack of $N$ distinct $a\times b$ color digital images from the $ab$ stacked pixel poles. More precisely, this paper shows how to use "Self Organizing Maps" (SOMs) to algorithmically reconstruct, unsupervised, a stack of distinct $a\times b$ color images from the collection of $1\times1\times3N$ stacked pixel poles using no apriori information about the original images. We evaluate the accuracy of the reconstructions as a function of $N$, we determine the effectiveness of the algorithm when the individual images are corrupted by noise, and we assess the model's performance when pure noise images are included in the stack.}
