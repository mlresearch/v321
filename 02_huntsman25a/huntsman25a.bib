abstract={We describe a unified and computationally tractable framework for finding outliers in, and maximum-diversity subsets of, finite metric spaces of strict negative type. Examples of such spaces include finite subsets of Euclidean space and finite subsets of a sphere without antipodal points. The latter accounts for state-of-the-art text embeddings, and we apply our framework in this context to sketch a hallucination mitigation strategy and separately to a class of path diversity optimization problems with a real-world example.}
