abstract: "  It can be shown that Stable Diffusion has a permutation-invariance property
  with respect to the rows of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) embedding
  matrices. This inspired the novel observation that these embeddings can naturally
  be interpreted as point clouds in a Wasserstein space rather than as matrices in
  a Euclidean space. This perspective opens up new possibilities for understanding
  the geometry of embedding space. For example, when interpolating between embeddings
  of two distinct prompts, we propose reframing the interpolation problem as an optimal
  transport problem. By solving this optimal transport problem, we compute a shortest
  path (or geodesic) between embeddings that captures a more natural and geometrically
  smooth transition through the embedding space. This results in smoother and more
  coherent intermediate (interpolated) images when rendered by the Stable Diffusion
  generative model. We conduct experiments to investigate this effect, comparing the
  quality of interpolated images produced using optimal transport to those generated
  by other standard interpolation methods. The novel optimal transport–based approach
  presented indeed gives smoother image interpolations, suggesting that viewing the
  embeddings as point clouds (rather than as matrices) better reflects and leverages
  the geometry of the embedding space."
