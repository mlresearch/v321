abstract: 'Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) typically scale with the number of graph edges,
  making them well suited for sparse graphs but less efficient on dense graphs, such
  as point clouds or molecular interactions. A common remedy is to sparsify the graph
  via similarity thresholding or distance pruning, but this forces an arbitrary choice
  of a single interaction scale and discards crucial information from other scales.
  To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view graph-tuple framework. Instead
  of a single graph, our graph-tuple framework partitions the graph into disjoint
  subgraphs, capturing primary local interactions and weaker, long-range connections.
  We then learn multi-view representations from the graph-tuple via a heterogeneous
  message-passing architecture inspired by the theory of non-commuting operators,
  which we formally prove is strictly more expressive and guarantees a lower oracle
  risk compared to single-graph message-passing models. We instantiate our framework
  on two scientific domains: molecular property prediction from feature-scarce Coulomb
  matrices and cosmological parameter inference from geometric point clouds. On both
  applications, our multi-view graph-tuple models demonstrate better performance than
  single-graph baselines, highlighting the power and versatility of our multi-view
  approach.'
