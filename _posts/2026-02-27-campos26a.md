abstract: Temporal link prediction seeks to model evolving networks to forecast future
  or missing interactions. Although many methods in this field achieve strong predictive
  performance, interpretability remains limited, especially in high-stakes domains.
  We address this by showing how topological data analysis can assess the faithfulness
  of learned representations to the underlying data, providing a pipeline for comparing
  temporal topological structure across modal output. We further introduce a prototypical
  model that enables this analysis while maintaining predictive power. Taken together,
  these contributions lay the groundwork for models whose representations are more
  transparent to end users.
