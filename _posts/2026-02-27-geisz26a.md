abstract: Sheaves have been used recently to model information on networks, such as
  the spread of opinions in a social network. Dynamical systems on networks model
  the evolving states of nodes on graphs. Using these lenses of sheaf theory and network
  dynamics, we explore a model of flocking. We describe from this perspective what
  it means for birds to come to consensus on flight velocities, and a system of ordinary
  differential equations (ODEs) that describes this consensus process. Then we couple
  these consensus dynamics with flight dynamics to describe a model of flocking. We
  include numerous visualizations of examples in 2 dimensions.
