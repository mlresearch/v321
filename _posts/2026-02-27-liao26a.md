abstract: Approximating the governing equations from data is of great importance in
  studying the dynamical systems. In this paper, we propose randomized neural networks
  (RaNN) to investigate the problem of approximating the governing equations of the
  system of ordinary differential equations. In contrast with other neural networks
  based methods, training randomized neural network solves a least-squares problem,
  which significant reduces the computational complexity. Moreover, we introduce a
  regularization term to the loss function, which improves the generalization ability.
  We provide an estimation of Lipschitz constant for our proposed model and analyze
  its generalization error. Our empirical experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate
  that our proposed method achieves good generalization performance and enjoys easy
  implementation.
