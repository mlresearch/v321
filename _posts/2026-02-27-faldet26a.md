abstract: We study the geometry of Vision Transformer (\texttt{ViT}) \texttt{[CLS]}
  representations across layers through the lens of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces
  (RKHS). For each layer and class, we estimate class-conditional kernel mean embeddings
  (KMEs) and measure separability with maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), tuning the
  kernel and a per-layer PCA projection via a bootstrap-based signal-to-noise (SNR)
  objective. We further propose a layer-wise confidence signal by evaluating class
  mean embeddings along a query’s \texttt{[CLS]} trajectory. On ImageNet-1k subsets,
  this exploratory, proof-of-concept analysis indicates that the RKHS framework can
  capture meaningful geometric and semantic signals in \texttt{[CLS]} representations
  across ViT layers. We make no SOTA claims; our contribution is a unified framework
  and practical recipe for probing \texttt{[CLS]} geometry.
