abstract: Local clustering aims to identify specific substructures within a large
  graph without any additional structural information of the graph. These substructures
  are typically small compared to the overall graph, enabling the problem to be approached
  by finding a sparse solution to a linear system associated with the graph Laplacian.
  In this work, we first propose a method for identifying specific local clusters
  when very few labeled data are given, which we term semi-supervised local clustering.
  We then extend this approach to the unsupervised setting when no prior information
  on labels is available. The proposed methods involve randomly sampling the graph,
  applying diffusion through local cluster extraction, then examining the overlap
  among the results to find each cluster. We establish the co-membership conditions
  for any pair of nodes, and rigorously prove the correctness of our methods. Additionally,
  we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve
  state of the art results in the low-label rates regime.
