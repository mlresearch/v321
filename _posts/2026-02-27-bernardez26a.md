  Data Science(TAG-DS 2025)
abstract: 'This paper describes the 2025 edition of the Topological Deep Learning
  Challenge: Expanding the Data Landscape, hosted at the first Topology, Algebra,
  and Geometry in Data Science (TAG-DS) Conference. This year’s challenge aimed to
  address the data bottleneck in the field by systematically expanding the ecosystem
  of Topological Deep Learning (TDL). Powered by TopoBench, the challenge was organized
  into two primary missions: enriching the data landscape with diverse datasets, and
  advancing core data infrastructure. In particular, participants were invited to
  contribute to the open-source platform by implementing new dataset loaders, designing
  new benchmark tasks, or engineering robust, scalable data pipelines. The initiative
  successfully yielded 44 qualifying submissions. This paper outlines the scope of
  the competition and summarizes the key results and findings, highlighting the new
  resources now available to the TDL community.'
