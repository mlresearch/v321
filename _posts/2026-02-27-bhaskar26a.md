abstract: We present DYMAG, a graph neural network based on a novel form of message
  aggregation. Standard message-passing neural networks, which often aggregate local
  neighbors via mean-aggregation, can be regarded as convolving with a simple rectangular
  waveform which is non-zero only on 1-hop neighbors of every vertex. Here, we go
  beyond such local averaging. We will convolve the node features with more sophisticated
  waveforms generated using dynamics such as the heat equation, wave equation, and
  the Sprott model (an example of chaotic dynamics). Furthermore, we use snapshots
  of these dynamics at different time points to create waveforms at many effective
  scales. Theoretically, we show that these dynamic waveforms can capture salient
  information about the graph, including connected components, connectivity, and cycle
  structures. Empirically, we test DYMAG on both real and synthetic benchmarks to
  establish that DYMAG outperforms baseline models on recovery of graph persistence,
  generating parameters of random graphs, as well as property prediction for proteins,
  molecules and materials. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/KrishnaswamyLab/DYMAG}.
