abstract: This paper introduces an approach that combines a transport-based model
  of hyperspectral pixels and a bootstrap sampling strategy to construct an ensemble
  of background subspaces in the signed cumulative distribution transform (SCDT) domain
  for robust anomaly detection in hyperspectral images characterized by complex and
  varied background clutter. Each spectral signal (i.e., pixel) is treated as an observation
  of an unknown background template pattern that has undergone unknown, but restricted,
  deformation due to factors such as shadowing, look angle, or atmospheric absorption.
  When combined with the SCDT—a transport-based transform with close connections to
  one-dimensional Wasserstein embedding—the model induces convexity of hyperspectral
  pixel representations in the SCDT space and facilitates the construction of subspace
  models that characterize dominant background signals. A bootstrap sampling strategy
  in the ambient domain yields an ensemble of background subspace models in SCDT domain
  and anomalies are subsequently detected as pixels that do not conform to any of
  the learned subspace models. Experiments on six benchmark hyperspectral datasets
  demonstrate that the approach effectively captures spectral variability and reliably
  detects anomalies with low false alarm rates, outperforming state-of-the-art comparison
  methods in most cases. These results underscore the potential of transport-based
  subspace representations for robust and interpretable hyperspectral anomaly detection
  across diverse imaging scenarios. Finally, the geodesic properties of the SCDT embedding
  are leveraged to provide a geometric interpretation of the method via visualization
  of paths between test signals and their subspace projections.
