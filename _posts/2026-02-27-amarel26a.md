abstract: We apply topological data analysis to characterize the simulated evolution
  of cracks in heterogeneous materials. Using persistence homology, we derive covariates
  for survival analysis, enabling lifetime prediction within a generalized linear
  modeling framework. Zeroth-homology features alone reproduce the ensemble survival
  curves of distinct materials, revealing that coarse topological statistics retain
  predictive signal even when important geometric details are abstracted away. We
  further compare the predictive capability of neural networks trained directly on
  damage fields with those trained on persistence-homology-derived representations,
  finding that the latter achieve superior accuracy. Finally, we investigate patched
  persistence homology, which encodes local topological information by computing persistence
  within spatial subdomains. This localized variant bridges global and geometric perspectives,
  capturing the collective mechanisms that govern fracture and may eventually yield
  representations better suited to the design and evaluation of fracture emulators.
