abstract: "We study the estimation problem of distribution-on distribution regression,
  where both predictors and responses are probability measures. Existing approaches
  typically rely on a global optimal transport map or tangent-space linearization,
  which can be restrictive in approximation capacity and distort geometry in multivariate
  underlying domains. In this paper, we propose the \\emph{Neural Local Wasserstein
  Regression}, a flexible nonparametric framework that models regression through locally
  defined transport maps in Wasserstein space. Our method builds on the analogy with
  classical kernel regression: kernel weights based on the 2-Wasserstein distance
  localize estimators around reference measures, while neural networks parameterize
  \ttransport operators that adapt flexibly to complex data geometries. This localized
  perspective broadens the class of admissible transformations and avoids the limitations
  of global map assumptions and linearization structures. We develop a practical training
  procedure using DeepSets-style architectures and Sinkhorn-approximated losses, combined
  with a greedy reference selection strategy for scalability. Through synthetic experiments
  on Gaussian and mixture models, as well as distributional prediction tasks on MNIST,
  we demonstrate that our approach effectively captures nonlinear and high-dimensional
  distributional relationships that elude existing methods."
