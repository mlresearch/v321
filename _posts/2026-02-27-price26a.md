abstract: A color digital photograph, of resolution $a\times b$, is typically stored
  as an $a\times b\times3$ array. The vector of length 3, sitting at a pixel, encodes
  its color in terms of intensity measurements of the red, green, and blue color bands.
  We call this length 3 vector a "pixel pole". Suppose we are given the $ab$ individual
  pixel poles as a jumbled collection of length 3 vectors and we wish to reconstruct
  the image, with no advanced knowledge concerning its content. In other words, we
  are given $ab$ color squares and we wish to "solve the pixel puzzle" meaning we
  want to reconstruct the original unknown image. As one can imagine, this is a difficult
  problem. In this paper, we show how to rebuild the images in a stack of $N$ distinct
  $a\times b$ color digital images from the $ab$ stacked pixel poles. More precisely,
  this paper shows how to use "Self Organizing Maps" (SOMs) to algorithmically reconstruct,
  unsupervised, a stack of distinct $a\times b$ color images from the collection of
  $1\times1\times3N$ stacked pixel poles using no apriori information about the original
  images. We evaluate the accuracy of the reconstructions as a function of $N$, we
  determine the effectiveness of the algorithm when the individual images are corrupted
  by noise, and we assess the model’s performance when pure noise images are included
  in the stack.
