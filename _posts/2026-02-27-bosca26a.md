abstract: This paper explores the topological signatures of ReLU neural network activation
  patterns. We consider feedforward neural networks with ReLU activation functions
  and analyze the polytope decomposition of the feature space induced by the network.
  Mainly, we investigate how the Fiedler partition of the dual graph and show that
  it appears to correlate with the decision boundary—in the case of binary classification.
  Additionally, we compute the homology of the cellular decomposition—in a regression
  task—to draw similar patterns in behavior between the training loss and polyhedral
  cell-count, as the model is trained.
