abstract: 'We interpret deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on elementary $p$ group
  multiplication, examining how our results reveal some of the nature within major
  deep learning hypotheses. Assisted by tools from computational algebra and geometry,
  we perform analyses at multiple levels of abstraction, finding we can fully characterize
  and describe: 1) the global algorithm DNNs learn on this task—the multidimensional
  Chinese remainder theorem; 2) the neural representations, which are 2-torus $\mathbb{T}^2$
  embedded in $\mathbb{R}^4$ encoding coset structure; 3) the individual neuron activation
  patterns, which activate solely on coset structures of the group. Furthermore, we
  find neurons learn the Lee metric to organize their activation strengths. Overall,
  our work serves as an exposition toward understanding how DNNs learn group multiplications.'
