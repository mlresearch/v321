abstract: In this paper, we propose Quasi Zigzag Persistent Homology (QZPH) as a framework
  for analyzing time-varying data by integrating multiparameter persistence and zigzag
  persistence. To this end, we introduce a stable topological invariant that captures
  both static and dynamic features at different scales. We present an algorithm to
  compute this invariant efficiently. We show that it enhances the machine learning
  models when applied to tasks such as sleep-stage detection, demonstrating its effectiveness
  in capturing the evolving patterns in time-varying datasets.
