abstract: Bilevel optimization is central to many machine learning tasks, including
  hyperparameter learning and adversarial training. We present a novel single-level
  reformulation for bilevel problems with convex lower-level objective functions and
  linear constraints. Our method eliminates auxiliary Lagrange multiplier variables
  by expressing them in terms of the original decision variables, which allows the
  reformulated problem to preserve the same dimension as the original problem. We
  applied our method to support vector machines (SVMs) and evaluated it on several
  benchmark tasks, demonstrating efficiency and scalability.
