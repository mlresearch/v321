abstract: We describe a unified and computationally tractable framework for finding
  outliers in, and maximum-diversity subsets of, finite metric spaces of strict negative
  type. Examples of such spaces include finite subsets of Euclidean space and finite
  subsets of a sphere without antipodal points. The latter accounts for state-of-the-art
  text embeddings, and we apply our framework in this context to sketch a hallucination
  mitigation strategy and separately to a class of path diversity optimization problems
  with a real-world example.
