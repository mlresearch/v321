abstract: In recent studies, the *Average Gradient Outer Product* (AGOP) has emerged
  as a powerful tool to understand feature learning in deep neural networks, particularly
  in supervised learning tasks such as image classification. In this work, we extend
  this perspective to unsupervised learning, particularly the task of subspace clustering.
  Building on the existing kernel-based subspace clustering approaches, we introduce
  a feature learning mechanism which iteratively projects the training data onto an
  averaged precision matrix.  Notably, the relevant feature learning matrix we derived
  is the inverse of the traditional AGOP matrix.   We explain this from the viewpoint
  of isotropic variance control in the latent domain, and  illustrate that the proposed
  projection mechanism refines the data distribution and orthogonalizes the data in
  the latent space. Empirically, we visualize the evolution of projected data distribution,
  kernel matrix, and the emergence of pronounced block-diagonal structure in affinity
  matrix on a toy example. Furthermore, our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art
  kernel-based subspace clustering method KTRR [Zhen et al., 2020] on the Extended
  Yale B dataset [Lee et al., 2005]. Full experiment implementation is available on
  [Github](https://github.com/HaohanZou/AGOP_subspace_clustering).
