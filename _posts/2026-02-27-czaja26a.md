abstract: We study the kernel PCA (kPCA) pre-image problem in image denoising by benchmarking
  classical algorithms and introducing two neural network adversarial pre-imaging
  models, DCGAN-KPCAnet and WGAN-KPCAnet. Our results show that WGAN-KPCAnet delivers
  superior reconstruction results and is robust to noise compared to baselines.
